This is the repo for my first web resume! You can find the live site [here](https://eduardo-verdeja.surge-sh)

This project is based of the [Gatsby Universal Starter](https://github.com/fabe/gatsby-universal). It also uses [html2canvas](https://html2canvas.hertzen.com/) and [jsPDF](https://github.com/MrRio/jsPDF) to generate a PDF resume from markdown content rendered by Gatsby and React.

Please send me a message if you have any questions and/or suggestions!
