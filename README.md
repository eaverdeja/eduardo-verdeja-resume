# Eduardo Verdeja - Fullstack web engineer

This is the repo for my first web resume! You can find the live site [here](https://eduardo-verdeja.surge-sh)

This project is based of the [Gatsby Universal Starter](https://github.com/fabe/gatsby-universal). It also uses [html2canvas](https://html2canvas.hertzen.com/) and [jsPDF](https://github.com/MrRio/jsPDF) to generate a PDF resume from markdown content rendered by Gatsby and React.

Please send me a message if you have any questions and/or suggestions!

# Roadmap

- Learn about CircleCI and use it for the first time in this project
- Add tools & techs (with logos) + Expertise/Time
    - Similar to what √Çngelo Ocan√£ did with his resume! https://angeloocana.com/pt/resume/
- Add a 'Jobs & Education' page with a timeline component
    - https://github.com/stephane-monnot/react-vertical-timeline
- Add multilanguage support for Portuguese
    - https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby-plugin-i18n
- Add a posts page so I can start writing and get a blog up and running. I *need* multilanguage support up and running for this the work I want it to work üåé !
