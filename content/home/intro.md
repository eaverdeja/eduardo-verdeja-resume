My name is Eduardo Alberto Verdeja. I'm a 26 year old fullstack web engineer with 5 years of hands-on experience. I enjoy seeing data flow in surprising and useful ways for my end users. I've built CRUD based applications to substitute fragile paper and excel based workflows and data driven dashboards that raise awareness on particular business issues.

I've been working at [FSB Comunicação](https://www.fsb.com.br/) for the last couple of years, the largest PR company in Brasil. It is dynamic and rewarding work. Being close to the users and the product at all times keeps the environment fresh and challenging. As the need arose, I've built knowledge about:

- 🔨 &nbsp; Data Modeling 
- 🗺 &nbsp; Building fullstack applications 
- 🃏 &nbsp; Integrating with external APIs 
- ✉ &nbsp;&nbsp;️&nbsp;️ Sending emails
- ↪ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;️ ️Webhooks
- 📡 &nbsp; Managing deploys, web servers and process management tools 
- ⏳ &nbsp; Project Management 
- ⏲ &nbsp; Agile Methodologies 
- 🤝 &nbsp; People skills
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 &nbsp; Much more. As a team, we've a built a culture on which we value self-organization and communication aside from the technical skills. 

I started my career working at an in-house lab at the PUC-Rio college. I joined a team building a Java based web app with a fingerprint scanner integration and was introduced to the world of web development. Since then, I moved on to the Laravel PHP framework and made several small to medium sized projects with it.

For the past year I've been switching my attention to technologies such as React, GraphQL, Node.js, static sites and serverless computing. Focusing on Javascript has been a conscious and rewarding decision so far. To a lesser extent, I've also tinkered with Vue, Typescript, Python and R. 

My other passion is music 🎵. I play the guitar 🎸 and have played with multiple bands over the years. Check it out!
